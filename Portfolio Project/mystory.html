    <h1>I Wasn't Always Into Programming</h1>

    <body>For the first two years of my working career, I was a mechanic. Cars were a newly discovered passion of mine
        and I was enjoying getting paid to fix them.
        After a while the stress and nuisance of it all made it not worth it anymore. I got a part-time job, learned
        HTML, CSS, C#, and JS and now; I'm looking to have a career in web development!
